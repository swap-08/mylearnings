<H2>Flash Detect</H2>

<div id="header"></div>

<!--<div class="floater">
<p>Flash cannot be detected in <b>Netscape 2</b>, <b>Explorer 3 and 4 on Mac</b>,
<b>Konqueror</b> and <b>Ice Browser</b>.</p>
<p>The Flash version cannot be detected in <b>Opera 5 on Mac and Linux</b>

<p>I have heard, but not tested, that this script works in Konqueror 3.2</p></div>

<P class="intro">This combination of JavaScript and VBScript will detect if your users have installed the
Flash plugin and, if so, which version.
After you have detected the presence/absence of the plugin, you can take appropriate measures.</p>

<P ID="toc"></p>-->

<p>Let's see if you have Flash installed and, if so, which version:</p>

<p class="accent">
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
<!--
if (flashinstalled == 2)
{
	if (flashversion)
		document.write("You have Flash version " + flashversion + " installed.");
	else
		document.write("You have Flash installed, but I can't detect the version.");
}
else if (flashinstalled == 1) document.write("You don't have Flash installed.");
else document.write("I can't find out if you have Flash installed.");
// -->
</script></p>

<!--<H3>JavaScript and VBScript</H3>

<p>The theoretical way to detect the Flash plugin is to check
either the array <code>navigator.plugins</code> or <code>navigator.mimeTypes</code>.
These arrays are filled with all plugins and mime types the browser
can handle and you can check them to see if it can deal with Flash movies.</p>

<p>Netscape 2 and Konqueror do not support either array, so you cannot detect Flash
in those browsers.</p>

<p>The plugins array is by far the most interesting because it also contains version
information, while the mimeTypes array only tells us whether the browser can handle the
<code>application/x-shockwave-flash</code> mime type (= if Flash is installed). The mime type
hasn't changed with Flash versions, though, so you cannot tell which version of Flash
the user has.</p>

<p>Since Opera on Mac and Linux, iCab and Hotjava only support the mimeTypes array, detecting
which Flash version is present is not possible in these browsers.</p>

<p>Explorer confuses the issue by leaving the arrays empty, even though both exist, so that according to
JavaScript Explorer never has any plugins and does not support any mime types. The only exception to this
rule is Explorer 5 on Mac, which supports both arrays (sensible decision!).</p>

<p>The only way to check for plugins in Explorer is by using VBScript. Here we encounter a new complication: Explorers
on Mac do not support VBScript, so it is fundamentally impossible to detect any plugin in Explorer 3 and 4
on Mac. As I said, Explorer 5 on Mac supports the Netscape way.</p>

<p>Finally, the VBScript is supposed to produce error messages, so it is not exactly an example of
clean coding. Until now I have found no better way.</p>


<H3>The script</H3>

<p>That said, let's go to the script:</p>

<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="Javascript"&gt;
&lt;!--

var flashinstalled = 0;
var flashversion = 0;
MSDetect = "false";
if (navigator.plugins && navigator.plugins.length)
{
	x = navigator.plugins["Shockwave Flash"];
	if (x)
	{
		flashinstalled = 2;
		if (x.description)
		{
			y = x.description;
			flashversion = y.charAt(y.indexOf('.')-1);
		}
	}
	else
		flashinstalled = 1;
	if (navigator.plugins["Shockwave Flash 2.0"])
	{
		flashinstalled = 2;
		flashversion = 2;
	}
}
else if (navigator.mimeTypes && navigator.mimeTypes.length)
{
	x = navigator.mimeTypes['application/x-shockwave-flash'];
	if (x && x.enabledPlugin)
		flashinstalled = 2;
	else
		flashinstalled = 1;
}
else
	MSDetect = "true";

// --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;

on error resume next

If MSDetect = "true" Then
	For i = 2 to 6
		If Not(IsObject(CreateObject("ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash." & i))) Then

		Else
			flashinstalled = 2
			flashversion = i
		End If
	Next
End If

If flashinstalled = 0 Then
	flashinstalled = 1
End If

&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre>

<H3>Explanation</H3>

<p>After the detect, the variable <code>flashinstalled</code> can have three values:</p>

<ul>
<li>2: Flash installed
<li>1: Flash not installed
<li>0: Unknown if Flash is installed
</UL>

<p>The variable <code>flashversion</code> contains the version of Flash. If the version is
unknown, it is 0.</p>

<p>In this page I <code>document.write</code> a little message based on the value of these two variables. You'll
have to decide exactly what to do with the information this script provides, especially what to do if you don't know
if Flash is installed.</p>

<h4>The JavaScript</h4>

<p>First of all, make <code>flashdetect</code> and <code>flashversion</code> 0
(we don't yet know if Flash is installed and which version it is) and make <code>MSDetect</code> false.
If we need the VBScript, it will be set to <code>true</code>.</p>

<pre>
var flashinstalled = 0;
var flashversion = 0;
MSDetect = "false";
</pre>


<p>We start the detect by seeing if <code>navigator.plugins</code> exists and, if it exists, if its <code>length</code>
is larger than zero. After all, the array itself exists in Explorer, but it does not contain any data
so its length is zero. The Netscape-style detect script that follows should only be executed if
the array is actually filled with data.</p>

<pre>
if (navigator.plugins && navigator.plugins.length)
{
</pre>

<p>Then we try to find the plugin <code>Shockwave Flash</code>.</p>

<pre>
	x = navigator.plugins["Shockwave Flash"];
</pre>

<p>If it exists</p>

<pre>
	if (x)
	{
</pre>

<p>we know that Flash is installed, so we set <code>flashinstalled</code> to 2.</p>

<pre>
		flashinstalled = 2;
</pre>

<p>Then we see if the plugin object has a property <code>description</code>.
<span class="smaller">(As far as
I know every browser that supports <code>navigator.plugins</code> also supports <code>description</code>,
but let's be careful)</SPAN></p>

<pre>
		if (x.description)
		{
</pre>

<p>If it's supported, we extract the Flash version from it. The description is always something
like <code>Flash 4.0 r47</code>. Therefore we take the number before the dot and put it in <code>flashversion</code>.</p>

<pre>
			y = x.description;
			flashversion = y.charAt(y.indexOf('.')-1);
		}
	}
</pre>

<p>If <code>navigator.plugins["Shockwave Flash"]</code> does not exist, Flash is probably not installed
so we set <code>flashinstalled</code> to 1.</p>

<pre>
	else
		flashinstalled = 1;
</pre>

<p>Finally a special case: Flash 2 has a special plugin name <code>Shockwave Flash 2.0</code>. If
this plugin is present, set the variables to <em>Flash 2 detected</em>:</p>

<pre>
	if (navigator.plugins["Shockwave Flash 2.0"])
	{
		flashinstalled = 2;
		flashversion = 2;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>If the plugins array is not supported, we see if the browser supports <code>navigator.mimeTypes</code>.
Again check the length for Explorer's sake.</p>

<pre>
else if (navigator.mimeTypes && navigator.mimeTypes.length)
{
</pre>


<p>Now we see if <code>navigator.mimeTypes['application/x-shockwave-flash']</code> exists, that is if this
MIME type can be handled by the browser. If it can, we check its property <code>.enabledPlugin</code>, which
is true if the plugin is actually installed
<span class="smaller">(I don't really understand why there is an <code>enabledPlugin</code> property,
in my view any plugin that's present is enabled by definition)</SPAN>.<br>
If it is, we set <code>flashinstalled</code> to 2, if it isn't we set it to 1.
Unfortunately, <code>navigator.mimeTypes</code> doesn't tell us which version is installed.</p>

<pre>
	x = navigator.mimeTypes['application/x-shockwave-flash'];
	if (x && x.enabledPlugin)
		flashinstalled = 2;
	else
		flashinstalled = 1;
}
</pre>

<p>Netscape and the minor browsers are ready now.</p>

<p>If neither array is supported we make <code>MSDetect</code> true so that the VBScript
will be executed. Of course this doesn't help Netscape 2, Konqueror and Explorer 3 and 4 on
Mac a bit, since they don't support VBScript. Too Bad.</p>

<pre>
else
	MSDetect = "true";
</pre>

<h4>The VBScript</h4>

<p>The VBScript is not exactly an example of beautiful coding. In fact, the script is supposed to
 produce errors.</p>

<p>The main problem is that the detect is done by trying to create an object
<code>ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash.[versionNumber]</code>. If this is done succesfully, the browser
supports this version of Flash. If this version of the plugin is not installed, however, Explorer
gives an error message because it cannot create the object.</p>

<p>Therefore we need to use the VBScript <code>on error</code> event handler to tell Explorer to continue
the script, no matter what.</p>

<pre>
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;

on error resume next
</pre>

<p>Then for the actual detect. First of all we check if <code>MSDetect</code> is true. If it is, we execute the rest of the VBScript.</p>

<pre>
If MSDetect = "true" Then
</pre>

<p>Now we try to create objects. Flash 2 is called <code>ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash.2</code>,
Flash 3 is called <code>ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash.3</code> etc. So what we need to do is create
all these objects and see which one of them doesn't give an error.</p>

<p>So we go through the versions</p>

<pre>
	For i = 2 to 6
</pre>

<p>and try to create an object for Flash version <code>i</code></p>

<pre>
		If Not(IsObject(CreateObject("ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash." & i))) Then
</pre>

<p>Now we come to the dirty bit. If Flash version <code>i</code> is not supported,
the browser gives an error, but since we told it to <code>resume next</code> it will nonetheless
execute the next command. However, if the Flash version is not supported, we don't want
anything to happen. That's why we check if the object is <em>not</em> present
(<code>Not(IsObject(etc))</code>) and if it isn't (if the error occurs) nothing should be done:</p>

<pre>
<DIV class="smaller" STYLE="text-align: right">[that's right, nothing]</DIV>
</pre>

<p>If the object can be created and is present, we've found the installed Flash version.
We set <code>flashinstalled</code> to 2 and <code>flashversion</code> to <code>i</code>.</p>

<pre>
		Else
			flashinstalled = 2
			flashversion = i
</pre>

<p>End all stuff, this is required in VBScript, it's the equivalent of closing brackets
<code>}</code> in JavaScript.</p>

<pre>
		End If
	Next
End If
</pre>

<p>If, after we've checked all possible versions, <code>flashinstalled</code> is still 0, it means that
Flash is not installed. Therefore we make it 1. We've tried to find Flash, but didn't find it.</p>

<pre>
If flashinstalled = 0 Then
	flashinstalled = 1
End If
</pre>

<p>That's it. Now you only have to write a little script that reads out <code>flashinstalled</code>
and <code>flashversion</code> and gives commands
for the several situations. Think carefully about what should happen if you don't know if Flash is installed.</p>

<H3>Flash detect without JavaScript</H3>

<p>There is a way of detecting Flash without JavaScript. You
have to create a tiny Flash movie that redirects the user to the Flash page and place it on a page with a META refresh
that redirects the user to the non-Flash page. If Flash works, the Flash redirect comes first, if it doesn't
work the browser executes the META refresh. For more details see the
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/flash/ts/documents/scriptfree_detection.htm"
	class="external" >Macromedia</a> site.</p>

<H3>Detecting other plugins</H3>

<p>Theoretically, using this script you should be able to detect other plugins. However, it rarely
succeeds. You have to find the correct MIME type for the Netscape style detect and the correct VB
Object for the Explorer style detect. Find the object by starting up your registry editor (Start -> Run
-> Regedit), opening to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and selecting the file extension of the plugin you want
to detect. The '<em>Content Type</em>' entry holds the MIME type, the '<em>Default</em>' entry contains
the VB Object we need.</p>

<p>Rewrite the function for the new objects, then try it. Unfortunately I cannot guarantee anything, some
plugins work differently.</p>

<h4>Real Player</h4>

<p>However, a reader has succeeded in implementing this detect for Real Player:</p>

<ul>
<li>MIME type: <code>RealPlayer</code></li>
<li>VB Object: <code>RealPlayer.RealPlayer(tm) ActiveX Control (32-bit)</code> (Real5)<br>
or <code>rmocx.RealPlayer G2 Control</code> (Real G2)</li>
</UL>

<h4>Acrobat</h4>

<p>It's also rumoured to work for Adobe Acrobat:</p>

<ul>
<li>MIME type: <code>application/pdf</code></li>
<li>VB Object: <code>Pdf.PdfCtrl.[version number]</code></li>
</UL>

<p>So to detect a specific version of Acrobat you have to use a loop similar to the one in the
VBScript above.</p>

<p>If you succesfully use this script to detect another plugin, please
<a href="../contact.html">let me know</a>.</p>
